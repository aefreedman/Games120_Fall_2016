caitlin falls - the raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan under my battlements - come you spirits that tend on mortal thought, unsex me here, and fill me from the crown to the toe top-full of direst cruelty.  Make thick my blood.  Stop up the access and passage to remorse that no compuctious visitings of nature shake my fell purpose.  Come thick night, and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, that my keen knife see not the wound it makes, and heaven not peep through the blanket of the dark to cry hold, hold!
