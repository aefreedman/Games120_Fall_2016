Sam - Adnan isn't so great? Are you kidding me? 
	When was the last time you saw a player with such an ability and movement with fox? 
	Adnan puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. 
	Simon breaks records. SJ breaks records. Adnan breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic.
